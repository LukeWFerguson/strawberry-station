						<h2>Strawberry Station News</h2>
						<a href="http://bit.ly/YhFuZh">Strawberry Station brings new vibe</a>
						<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: x-small;">

						<p>
							If Portland needs a “vibe,” it may have found one.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I feel like we’ve created a location,” said Ken Robson of Strawberry Station.
						</p>
						<p>
							Robson bought the old Farmer’s Bank building on Main Street last May and is turning it into a mini-mall. The ribbon-cutting is scheduled for Friday.
						</p>
						<p>
							Robson bought the building almost on a whim.
						</p>
						<p>
							“There was an auction by the city, and I saw the sign (for it), and went the next day,” he said. “I don’t know what it was, but I just thought it was good. I could see something. I think it was meant to be.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Robson referenced the revitalization of Franklin, Tenn. and Franklin, Ky. as similar situations.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I really think we can do the same thing here in Portland,” he said.
						</p>
						<p>
							He calls the building “Strawberry Station,” which features six office areas open for rent and an “event room.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“We don’t need to lose downtown,” Robson said. “I hope this gives it new life, and I hope people enjoy it. We need to enjoy it, and get people who don’t like malls away from them.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Robson said he has renovated the building to make it more attractive.
						</p>
						<p>
							“It’s elegant,” he said. “We’ve tried to do something special with it.”
						</p>
						<p>
							He hopes it will it ignite Main Street.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I haven’t parked on that side of (Main Street) in probably 12 years,” Robson said. “The street looked desecrated. My wife said, ‘don’t go to that auction,’ but I just had a feeling. I just felt there was a reason.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Hopefully, this is a rejuvenation of (Main Street),” he added. “I can see the potential, and I hope this is a spark.”
						</p>
						<p>
							A grand opening/ribbon cutting event will be held at 2 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 7. The public is welcome to visit and see what he’s done with the building.
